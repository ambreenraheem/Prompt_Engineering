How LLMs Really Work Behind the Scenes (No Magic, Just Math) 🚀

Ever wondered what’s actually happening inside GPT, Claude, or LLaMA when you type a question? Here’s the “movie” playing in the background:

1️⃣ Words become tokens and then numbers
Your text is split into tokens (words or subwords). Each token is turned into a high-dimensional vector—thousands of numbers that capture meaning.

2️⃣ Order matters (positional encoding)
Transformers don’t know word order by default, so we add positional signals telling the model if a token is first, last, or somewhere in between.

3️⃣ The “attention” magic
Every token looks at every other token to figure out what’s relevant. This self-attention step is like having all words in a sentence talk to each other, regardless of distance.
And with multi-head attention, the model does this several times in parallel—spotting grammar in one head, tone in another, and meaning in another.

4️⃣ Feedforward thinking
After attention, each token’s vector passes through a mini-neural network (MLP) that adds new knowledge and transforms it further.

5️⃣ Residuals & normalization
To keep learning stable, the input and output of each block are added together (residuals) and normalized. Think of it as “memory foam” for data—retaining what matters and smoothing the rest.

6️⃣ Layer upon layer
Powerful LLMs stack this process dozens of times.
▪️Early layers: capture basic word meanings
▪️Middle layers: detect relationships and patterns
▪️Final layers: combine everything into a deep context

7️⃣ Output generation
At the end, vectors are turned into probabilities for the next token using a softmax. The model picks the most likely one… then repeats until your sentence is complete.

So next time ChatGPT gives you an answer—it’s not guessing. It’s running a massive, highly-orchestrated information exchange at lightning speed!
